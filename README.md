## GoT Character relevance evolution

- Pick your favourite GoT characters

- Rank the relevance of these 5 characters across the 5 books using the criteria you think fits better this situation. The most relevant of the five characters in book1 should get a score of 5 and the least relevant a score of 1, and so on.

- Chart the relevance evolution of the different characters

- Try to automate as much as possible, do not do things for each book in separate cells and then manually merge, etc.
